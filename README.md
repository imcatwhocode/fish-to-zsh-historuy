# @imcatwhocode/fish-to-zsh-history

This is a simple script that converts your fish shell history to zsh history.

**This script wasn't really tested, so use it at your own risk.**

## Usage

Requires Bun.

```sh
# To preview output to stdout
bun x github:imcatwhocode/fish-to-zsh-history

# If you brave enough
bun x github:imcatwhocode/fish-to-zsh-history > ~/.zsh_history
```
